# GoogleMLCapstone
Capstone project submission for Google MachineLearning course in Udacity

## Abstract
This project was undertaken as part of the Machine Learning Nanodegree Program
offered by Udacity (https://www.udacity.com).  It is a supervised learning problem
that uses data sets acquired data/features was derived from the US Geological Survey 
and USFS, the forest types, our the targeted predication results, was determined by USFS. 
The study area where the data derived from includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch. Our goal is to predict an integer classification for the forest cover type. The seven types are:

1 - Spruce/Fir
2 - Lodgepole Pine
3 - Ponderosa Pine
4 - Cottonwood/Willow
5 - Aspen
6 - Douglas-fir
7 - Krummholz


## Requirements
In order to run the project, Python 2.7 must be installed, along with the following
packages (note that the versions are those used on my machine - it is possible that
the code will run with earlier versions of the packages, and almost certain that it
will run with later versions):
* numpy (version 1.10.4)
* pandas (version 0.18.0)
* sklearn (version 0.17.1)
* matplotlib (version 1.3.1)

## Acknowledgements
As mentioned above, the data set used in this project was generously uploaded by
the University of California at Irvine through their Machine Learning Repository.
